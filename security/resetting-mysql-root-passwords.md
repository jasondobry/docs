# Resetting MySQL Root Passwords
If you forget your password to your MySQL or MariaDB database, this procedure shows you how to gain access in order to reset the password. It requires a user with sudo access to execute.
## Step 1: Identify your database version
Depending on your choice between MySQL and MariaDB as your operating system, some commands, file paths, and system services will differ. If necessary, you can check your version by issuing:
```
mysql --version
```
If you're running MySQL, the output will resemble:
```
mysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.7.16, for Linux (x86_64) using EditLine wrapper
```
If you're running MariaDB, it will be something like:
```
mysql  Ver 15.1 Distrib 5.5.52-MariaDB, for Linux (x86_64) using readline 5.1
```
If you're using MySQL, continue to Step 2 below. If you're using MariaDB, see Step 2 in [Resetting MariaDB root passwords](https://www.thermo.io/how-to/security/resetting-mariadb-root-passwords).
## Step 2: Stop the database server
Before changing the root password, you must first terminate the database server:
```
sudo systemctl stop mysql
```
## Step 3: Restart the database server without permissions
To gain root access without a password, you can start MySQL while preventing them from loading the grant tables that store user privilege information.
**Attention:** Because this step contains potential security risk, it is best practice to disable networking as shown below. Additionally, the ampersand at the end is required to allow you to continue to use your console by pushing the process to the background.

To do so, issue:
```
sudo mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables --skip-networking &
```
Then, to connect to the server as the root user without the password, issue:
```
mysql -u root
```
## Change the root password
First, reload the grant tables, which you will need for Step 5:
```
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
Then, change the root password with one of the following two commands, but replace `<new_password>` and the angled brackets (`<>`) with your actual password:
* For MySQL 5.7.6 and later, use:
```
ALTER USER ‘root’@’localhost’ IDENTIFIED BY ‘<new_password>’;
```
* For MySQL 5.7.5 and earlier, use:
```
SET PASSWORD FOR ‘root’@’localhost’ = PASSWORD(‘<new_password>’);
```
If successful, you will see the output:
```
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```
## Step 5: Restart your database server
First, stop the database server you launched in Step 3:
```
sudo kill `cat /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid`
```
Next, restart the service using `systemctl`:
```
sudo systemctl start mysql
```
Finally, check your work by confirming the new password works as intended:
```
mysql -u root -p
```
Your work is done! You now have regained administrative access to your MySQL server.
